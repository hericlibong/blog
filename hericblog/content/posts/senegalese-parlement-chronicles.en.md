## Invisible Members of Parliament

**As many people, I was concerned by the scenes of tension** that accompanied the [opening of the parliamentary session in Senegal](https://www.lemonde.fr/afrique/article/2022/09/13/bagarres-insultes-et-micro-arrache-au-senegal-une-rentree-parlementaire-mouvementee_6141415_3212.html) 
of last September 12. But behind the violence and the deplorable insults, what concerns me the most when talking about the National Assembly is the lack of information that can be found online about the deputies. 
<br> 

There are lots of official numbers, party or coalition lists; percentages on the ballot, on gender. And local news sites provide regular and accurate reports of the work of the hemicycle, but none of them take the time to work on profiles, backgrounds, ideological contexts or even pictures.

The official [website of the National Assembly](http://www.assemblee-nationale.sn/) offers some useful data on the current legislature. But, apart from that, if you want to know more about the people who are in charge of the daily concerns of the people, you will have to rely on your imagination.<br>

That's why I decided to start a series of articles with interactive visuals about the National Assembly of Senegal. Its distribution in seats, the deputies, but also the history, the composition of the commissions, the offices, the vote of the laws etc. Basically, everything that can be collected in data and converted into graphics.<br>

As an introduction to this step-by-step work, I will simply use the data retrieved from the [assembly website](http://www.assemblee-nationale.sn/) and view the official figures for the distribution of seats by coalition, by gender, and a map of the representation of the deputies and the departments they represent.<br>

For this time, I use [Flourish](https://flourish.studio/) for the graphics but in the future I would not forbid myself to use other applications or libraries.
